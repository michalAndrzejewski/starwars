This is a Python challenge to download Star Wars API data from :
https://swapi.co/api/people/, save and present in the system. 
Functionality of going through files with data is provided

###### Programmers limitations and problems that took time:

- in views file, one of functions was called download, which caused 
an overriding of some other function, and generated error

###### Improvements:

- Data should be stored in a database, in order to have a full access and 
changes tracking - an ETL should be added to check if data exists or 
was changed (example Lookup transformation in SSIS)

###### System schema (rough):


###### Time:
Planning ~ 1h
